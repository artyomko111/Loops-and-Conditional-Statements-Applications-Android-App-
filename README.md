# Loops and Conditional Statements Practice

A set of programs demonstrating loops and conditional statements:  
- Sum of odd numbers up to n using a for loop.  
- Product of odd numbers down to 1 using a while loop.  
- Prime factorization of an input number using a while loop.  
- Triangle classification based on three side lengths (any order), determining type (not a triangle, right, obtuse, acute, equilateral, isosceles) with visual display (canvas or image).
